# scr-pnp-precon
Preconstructed decks for Sorcery: Contested Realm. These PDFs have both card faces and card backs on the same sheet with a midline fold guide to allow the creation of more traditional cards for your print-and-play testing. Deck lists current as of 12.28.21. Some cards may not reflect recent changes, however I'll attempt to keep files updated. Post any feedback here or you can find me on the Sorcery discord Christo#3822 - hope this helps some of you! I'll post a video soon showing how I make these cards. Below is a little preview.
