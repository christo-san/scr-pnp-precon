Preconstructed decks for Sorcery: Contested Realm. These PDFs have both card faces and card backs on the same sheet with a midline fold guide to allow the creation of more traditional cards for your print-and-play testing. Deck lists current as of 12.28.21. Some cards may not reflect recent changes, however I'll attempt to keep files updated. Post any feedback here or you can find me on the Sorcery discord Christo#3822 - hope this helps some of you! I'll post a video soon showing how I make these cards. Below is a little preview.

Printing Tips!
1. Make sure the print settings are set to high quality
2. The paper you use can massively affect the final print. I use Epson Ultra Premium Presentation Paper MATTE. Quality is great, but cards don't slide well against each other and best inserted in sleeves. Working on finding better paper options for a more traditional card feel
3. Make sure the paper type setting matches the actual paper media you've loaded into your feeding tray
